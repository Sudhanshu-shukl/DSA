# DSA Learning & Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning folder. This repository is organized by topic, with each folder containing code and notes for that area.

| 03 Arrays | Array concepts and problems (easy to hard) |
| 04 Patterns | Pattern printing and related logic |
| 05 Recursion | Recursive algorithms and problems |
| 06 Sorting | Sorting algorithms and their applications |
| 07 Binary Search | Binary search in 1D/2D arrays, search space problems |
| 08 Strings | String manipulation and algorithms |
| 09 Linked List | Single, double, and advanced linked list problems |
| 10 Stacks and Queues | Stack/queue concepts, implementation, and problems |
| 11 Sliding Window & Two Pointer | Sliding window and two-pointer techniques |
| 12 Heaps | Heap data structure, problems, and applications |
| 13 Greedy | Greedy algorithms and related problems |
| 14 Trees | Binary trees, traversals, and tree problems |
| 15 Graphs | Graph algorithms and problems |

## Folder Structure

- Each folder (e.g., `01 Math/`, `02 Bit Manipulation/`, etc.) contains code and notes for that topic.
- File names describe the problem or concept implemented.

---

## Languages Used

- **C** is used for most problems to get a low-level grasp of data structures and algorithms.
- **Python** is used when the focus is on understanding concepts without boilerplate-heavy code.
- **Java** is used for topics like hashmaps and other features that C does not have, and where Python makes things too easy or abstracts away important details.

## Notes

- This is a personal learning resource.
- Progress is tracked in my own notes or can be added here as checklists if needed.
- Feel free to browse and use for your own learning.

## How to Use

- Browse to any topic folder to see code and notes.
- Use the folder names and descriptions above to find the topic you want to study or revise.
